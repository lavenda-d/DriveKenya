2. **Renters/Customers**: Locals, tourists, and businesses needing temporary transportation
3. **Administrators**: Platform managers ensuring quality, safety, and user satisfaction

### **Mission & Vision**
**Mission**: Democratize vehicle rental in Nairobi by connecting vehicle owners directly with renters through technology.

### **Data Flow**

**1. Authentication Flow:**
```
User → Login Form → POST /api/auth/login → JWT Token → 
localStorage → All Subsequent Requests (Bearer Token) → 
Middleware Verification → Protected Resources
```

**2. Booking Flow:**
```
Browse Vehicles → Select Vehicle → Choose Dates → Pick Location (Google Maps) → 
Select Payment → Create Booking (POST /api/bookings) → 
Notification to Owner (WebSocket) → Owner Accepts → 
Notification to Renter → Booking Confirmed
```

**3. Chat Flow:**
```
User Opens Chat → Socket.io Connection → Join Room (booking_ID) → 
Send Message → Emit to Server → Save to DB → 
Broadcast to Room → Other User Receives → 
Push Notification if Offline
```

### **Design Patterns Used**

1. **MVC Pattern**: Models (Database) → Controllers (Routes) → Views (React Components)
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic separated into services/
3. **Middleware Chain**: Express middleware for auth, validation, error handling
4. **Repository Pattern**: Database access abstracted through config/database-sqlite.js
5. **Observer Pattern**: WebSocket events for real-time updates
6. **Singleton Pattern**: Database connection, Socket.io instance
7. **Factory Pattern**: Component creation in React
8. **Strategy Pattern**: Different payment methods, authentication strategies
